üìä Sorting Algorithm Performance Analyzer
This project is a deep dive into the practical performance of five classic sorting algorithms. It's not just about theory; it's about seeing how these algorithms actually behave when you run them on different kinds of data.

The script implements each algorithm, runs them on arrays of increasing size, and benchmarks their execution time across best-case, average-case, and worst-case scenarios. Finally, it uses matplotlib to generate plots that visually tell the story of their efficiency.

üöÄ Algorithms Implemented
The following five algorithms were implemented and analyzed:

Insertion Sort: A simple, intuitive algorithm that is efficient for small or nearly-sorted datasets. (O(n 
2
 ))

Merge Sort: A highly efficient and stable divide-and-conquer algorithm. (O(nlogn))

Quick Sort (Iterative): A very fast divide-and-conquer algorithm, implemented iteratively to handle large datasets without recursion limits. (O(nlogn) on average)

Heap Sort: An efficient comparison-based sort that uses a binary heap data structure. (O(nlogn))

Modified Quick Sort: An optimized version of Quick Sort that uses a median-of-three pivot selection strategy and switches to Insertion Sort for small subarrays. This hybrid approach helps prevent worst-case performance.

üìà Analysis & Key Findings
The plots generated by this script clearly demonstrate the theoretical time complexities of these algorithms.

The O(n 
2
 ) Struggle: Insertion Sort starts fast on small arrays but its performance degrades exponentially as the input size grows, making it impractical for large datasets.

The Power of O(nlogn): Merge Sort, Heap Sort, and Quick Sort are significantly faster and scale much more effectively, proving why they are staples in computer science.

Worst-Case Scenarios: The standard Quick Sort struggles with already sorted data (its worst-case), but the Modified Quick Sort handles it gracefully thanks to its smarter pivot selection. This highlights the importance of algorithmic optimizations in real-world applications.
